            <p>I am a student with 4 years of study in Kinesiology and Health and Fitness. I've participated in a plethora of jobs and volunteer opportunities; including  being a basketball coach, soccer referee, facilitating diabetes workshops, manual labour, a strength coach and fitness instructing. My passion is in strength sports and coaching individuals towards their health goals.</p>

        <h2>Volunteer Experiences</h2>
        <p>From my internship experiences with Upper Canada College, International FC Academy and Humber College, I've gained valuable coaching and monitoring skills. My internships have presented me with a multitude of  valuable challenges which I overcame and learned from.  These endeavors have forced me to operate in an incredibly fast paced environment, while maintaining positivity and motivating my team and clients to push towards their goals.</p>
        <p>My first internship at International FC Academy exposed me to new experiences that forced me to work in a timely manner. Every part of practice was scheduled strictly, and that required me to always be in control of the athletes when leading drills. Projection of voice was another soft skill I learned throughout my first placement. Because of the facility environment, a loud voice was requried to coach the players effectively. Often I'd leave placement with sore vocal cords, because previously I was not accustomed to this sort of coaching.</p>
        <p>Volunteering for a service learning workshop at a diabetes clinic opened my eyes to another side of the health industry. It offered a new perspective, showing me the diseased population and their physical cababilities and struggles. Before this volunteer opportunity, I was mostly exposed to healthy, fit individuals. After this opportunity I was humbled, now aware of the capacity of the human body in an unhealthy state.</p>
        <p>My current internship at Upper Canada College provides incredible experiences, working alongside a head strength coach with a wealth of knowledge. Rather than teaching me specific facts, he has stoked the proverbial fire in my mind about fitness and strength as a whole. I've solidified my knowledge of strength progression, programming and communication skills. I've also received very valuable career advice: further education is required to become a strength coach. He's made me aware on two courses that he personally enrolled in: MAT and RTS. MAT is Muscular Activation Technique, which is a rehabilitation technique that involves manual therapy to reset the neuromuscular connection to strengthen weak muscles. RTS is Resistance Training Specialist, which is a physics based resistance training course that involves immersing yourself in the forces associated with getting stronger.</p>
